# SydBot-baseline
A chatbot that runs locally as a Node.js program with ChatGPT connection and audio playing script.

## ChatBot Basics
The ChatBot works off of the example given at https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/chat/chatbot-guide/

To enhance the ChatBot for my own personal wants, I've added a python script that will open the media player on Windows and play audio clips, functioning similar to the Blerp extension but locally.
OpenAI Integration was also added so that people within the chatroom can trigger the bot to respond to prompts for added engagement.

## Setup
You will need Python installed on your system as well as PythonShell and OpenAI within the project.

```
npm install python-shell
```

```
npm install openai
```

### Connecting to Twitch
You will need to create a second Twitch account for the bot to run through. If you want to use the same email as your regular Twitch account to register the bot, the following video was helpful for this:

Retrieving user IDs for your chatbot and your actual Twitch account can be done at https://www.streamweasels.com/tools/convert-twitch-username-%20to-user-id/

Retrieve your client ID by registering an app at https://dev.twitch.tv/ using the bot's Twitch account.

Oauth token can be retrieved by using a link such as the following and entering your client ID in the appropriate place as well as your redirect URI (I just use localhost).
```
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize
    ?response_type=token
    &client_id=YOURCLIENTID
    &redirect_uri=http://localhost
    &scope=user%3Aread%3Achat+user%3Awrite%3Achat
```

The page will not load as a valid page, but you will be able to locate the token within your browser's address bar.

### Playing Audio Files
Audio files should be placed in the audio/ folder and ideally be .mp3 format. Note that these files will be played through your system's default media player. This could cause the media to jump to the foreground and interrupt gameplay, but I find this is not an issue when the media player is running in a second screen. I will consider looking into the pygame module in the future as I believe this can be used to play audio files as background processes but I'm satisfied with the current state running the system's media player for the time being.

Note that you will need to keep track of your audio file's exact names and enter them into the bot.js code accordingly in order to avoid crashes.

### OpenAI Integration
You will need to create an OpenAI account if attempting to use the ChatBot with it.

You will then need to go retrieve a secret key to access the API via OpenAI at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

Subsequently, go into the console within the ChatBot directory and enter the following:
```
setx OPENAI_API_KEY 'enter your secret key here'
```
This will allow the chatbot to access the OpenAI API. You may need to pay in order for access to the API to succeed when making calls, though that gpt-4o-mini is arguably cheap when just doing text prompts.


Have fun.
